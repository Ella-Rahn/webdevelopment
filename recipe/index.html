<img src="elote-6.webp" height="525" width="525"/>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 3/4 cup finely grated Cotija cheese (about 2 1/2 ounces)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup Mexican crema or sour cream </li>
    <li> 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 medium limes)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or ground chipotle (optional)</li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
    <li>6 ears fresh corn on the cob, husked and silks removed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, such as canola</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>Tajín seasoning, for sprinkling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>

    <li>Stir 3/4 cup grated Cotija cheese, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup Mexican crema (use 2 tablespoons if the crema is thin like heavy cream), 1/4 cup lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper if using, and 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika together in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Place 6 husked ears of corn on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and use your hands to coat and flip the corn until evenly coated. Season all over with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
    <li>Heat an outdoor grill for direct, medium-high heat (450ºF to 475ºF). Place the corn on the grill (reserve the baking sheet). Cover and grill, turning the ears every 3 to 4 minutes, until the corn is tender and slightly charred in spots on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes total. Return the corn to the baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Let the corn sit until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Generously spread the Cotija mixture over all sides of the corn. Sprinkle with Tajín seasoning and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro leaves if desired. Serve with any remaining Cotija mixture.</li>

</ol>
